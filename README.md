Code for: The effect of strain level diversity on robust inference of virus-induced mortality
=============================


The modified dilution method is used to evaluate the rate of viral-induced mortality within phytoplankton communities. Here, we (Beckett and Weitz, 2018) consider the robustness of dilution based estimates of viral-induced mortality and how these may be affected by variation in life-history traits, including the infection latent period, and strain level diversity.
